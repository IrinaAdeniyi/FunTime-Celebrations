## Building process
1. I started the project by creating the index.html and adding some of the links required in the project: meta links, favicons, CSS stylesheet, Bootstrap links, font awesome. I then created the layout of the home page.

2. I followed with the navigation bar and I created the remaining pages, adding the navbar, the boilerplate structure and the footer on each page.

3. I played with some color options to find something that I would like.

4. I then added the header and the *About us* section.

5. I proceeded to work on the *Services* section on the *Home* page.

6. I further styled the navbar and made the page responsive on mobiles and tablets. I finally tested the home page and moved to the next page *Services*.

7. On the services page I firstly added the background photo and text for each service: themes, entertainment, venues and food.

8. I then investigated how I can add some flip cards to present the offered packages. I struggled to make it work with Bootstrap, but managed to use some advice some W3Schools and make the cards flip.

9. I tested the *Services* page's links and responsiveness and made the necessary corrections.

10. As the *Gallery* page was a *should-have* page, I decided to continue with the booking form page, which was a *must-have*.

11. For the *Book Now* page I used a Bootstrap Form and added field for personal details like name and age, for email and phone number. I used dropdowns for *Party Package*, *Date and Time*, *Theme*, and *Enterntaiment*. Finally, I choose a textbox which requires the number of guests and offers flexibility to add any other requests or comments.

12. I continued by adding the background of the page, the title of the page and the

# Troubleshooting
1. I had an initial issue with the favicon, as I was unsure how to create a new one for my website. After reading the documentation I was able to add the right favicon for my website and make it work.

2. I encountered an issue with the navbar position, but after carefully reading the documentation on Bootstrap it was resolved.

3. I struggled to position the text in the footer (Contact section) - but was resolved reading documentation. 

4. While styling the navbar, the CSS I used to change the text colour in the navbar overrode the *active* class from Bootstrap. After researching I managed to find the solution by targeting the *active* class and giving it a different colour and style them bold.

5. I discovered I used a redundant class for the hero section and rectified the mistake.

6. The *About us* section on the home page kept showing next to the hero section. I managed to resolved this by using the flex-column class from Bootstrap.

7. I had issues with the way the page was scrolling and after investigating I realised I set a height to the hero section, which was interfering with the way the page was displayed - it was cut instead of scrolling.

8. The home page was not showing properly on mobiles and tablets, so I used media queries to adjust how the navbar, text, cards and footer look on these screens.
